        <h1>Welcome to the Pocket Manager App!</h1>

        <p>
            The Pocket Manager app was created as a way for me to stay organized as a league commisioner. 
            Imagine that this app was created in the early days of fantasy football, before it became 
            mainstream, before ESPN, Yahoo, CBS, and many others offered their own platforms for organizing
            players into manageable rosters.
            <br><br>
            In the spirit of this, the Pocket Manager App provides a platform for me, as a commissioner, to
            stay organized with respect to which players are on which rosters, and how each roster performs week
            in and week out. Players earn points based on the following:
        </p>

        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Events</th>
                <th>Points Earned</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Passing Yard</td>
                <td>0.04</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Rushing/Receiving Yard</td>
                <td>0.1</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Passing Touchdown</td>
                <td>4</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Rushing/Receiving Touchdown</td>
                <td>6</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p>
            This app is largely a tool for me to experiment with teams in my league, and to simulate how my team,
            and other teams that I'm interested in, would stack up against other teams in the league.

            Thank you for checking it out!
